# Note-Taker 2/16/2023

## Description

This project is an note taking application that uses node, javascript, npm, and heroku to run. The user will be welcomed by a home page that displays a button to begin "note taking". This button will then take the user to another "notes" page where they will have the ability to write notes with a title and text as well as delete previous notes.
